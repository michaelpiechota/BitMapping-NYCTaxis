This program reads in an extract of destinations (in latitude and longitude) of taxi rides within the 5 boroughs of NYC. 
Each destination is plotted as a point on a gray scale bitmap. The output of the bitmap will be a "heat map" where each pixel is coded brighter
the more that it is visited (each pixel = a destination).
